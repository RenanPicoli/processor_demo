# processor_demo
Setup for testing microprocessor repo (https://github.com/RenanPicoli/microprocessor, ALWAYS USE branch MASTER of microprocessor) and IIR system identification in Altera DE2-115 board

* ~This branch is intended to create a fifo with different clocks for reading and writing~
* ~For writing, new data should be pushed through a shift register~
* ~For reading, only a pointer should be updated.~
* ~All data should be multiplexed on output port, that pointer will be the selection input~
* ~DON'T PUSH to I2S/master, until it is stable enough to be merged with processor_demo/master.~
* ~PUSH to I2S/smart_fifo_refactoring instead.~

* Tries to adapt filters of up to 8 weights (direct form I, feed-forward + feddback).
* Implements all elements, from registers to multipliers, multiply-accumulate, fpu, except PLL. The number of FPGA logical elements might be a restriction.
* A filtered audio signal is fed to the system, which performs a Full gradient IIR LMS algorithm to identify the filter used (guess its coeffients).
* reads inputs and previous outputs from a file, applies a IIR filter, then writes the new output to data_out output.
* Processor reads this output, compares it with the desired response, performs calculations and updates filter coefficients.
* Processor executes 1 instruction per cycle, its clock runs at 4 MHz.
* My intention was to run at 50 MHz, but this was postponed because I need learn about timing considerations (I learned this when trying to run at 50MHz: one of the ALU operands was arriving after the clock edge and messing everything)
* Added specialized hardware for: inner product, address decoding, vector multiply-add_accumulate (with multiplication by scalar).
* Since the file was generated by downsampling (2x) an audio sample recorded at 44100 Hz, the filter sampling frequency is 22050 Hz.
* In order to have real time processing, processor must process each new sample with 453 instructions, at most.
* The clock signal is provided by the onboard 50MHz oscillator, which is passes through a firts PLL to produce 5MHz, whose output is fed to a second PLL to generate 220500 Hz sampling clock, after this we use a factor 10 prescaler to produce sampling frequency (22050 Hz).
* The filter has only one input (single precision current sample) and only one output (single precision current output), previous samples are stored inside the filter.
* Filter coefficients will be updated every sampling edge, as long as a WREN signal is held high on the previous sampling edge.

## branches
* master: main branch, instructions are stored at mini_rom, a small, synchronous RAM memory with hard-coded content.
* async_SRAM: almost the same as master, but instructions are stored at the DE2-115 asynchronous SRAM, retrieved by i-cache/d-cache and presented to cpu. This branche is useful for tests involving only software changes 9no need for recompiling the FPGA).
* SRAM_caches_only: simplified version of async_SRAM, only includes peripherals like i-cache, d-cache, LCD controller and memory decoder. This branch is useful for for tests involving changing only cpu, since the compile time of this branch is much faster than masters' and async_SRAM's.
* async_SRAM_LCD_by_SW: old branch, unused. This was a branch derived of async_SRAM. async_SRAM_LCD_by_SW would additionally drive the board LCD signals entirely by software (no LCD specialized controller).
