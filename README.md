Setup for testing microprocessor repo (https://github.com/RenanPicoli/microprocessor) and a IIR filter in Altera DE2-115 board

* A IIR filter reads inputs and previous outputs from a file, then writes the new output to data_out output.
* Since the file was generated by downsampling (2x) an audio sample recorded at 44100 Hz, the filter sampling frequency is 22050 Hz.
* Microprocessor is intended to run a program for filter coefficients update.
* The clock signal is provided by the onboard 50MHz oscillator, which is passes through a factor 10 prescaler, whose output is fed to a PLL to generate 220500 Hz sampling clock, after this we use another factor 10 prescaler to produce sampling frequency (22050 Hz).
* The filter has only one input (single precision current sample) and only one output (single precision current output), previous samples are stored inside the filter.
* Filter coefficients might be updated every sampling edge, as long as a WREN signal is held high on the previous sampling edge.
